# Interpeption of the Rules about Land Ownership and Execution Rights

Author: 1F616EMO; Status: *Draft*

On 14 March 2024, a conflict happened between Underscore[^1] and Annmaria because of different understandings of land ownership. Annmaria builds some blocks in (at the time) unprotected areas within the Plain Houses Area (Coordinates: -91,26,18). At the same time, Underscore considers the land as 1F616EMO's land as the Plain Houses Area is constructed by them. As a result, Underscore stopped Annmaria by placing down protection blocks (forming protection areas) and removing Annmaria's build.

Consequently, 1F616EMO joined and solved the conflict by giving Annmaria the right to build in a redefined area around the original area. To clarify, the following interpeptions are made according to article (3) of section 1 of the Rules:

1. For unprotected areas without any builds, even if they can be considered one's property by common sense (for example, by being part of an administrative region), they shall not be considered so.
2. Article (5) of section 2 of the Rules applies regardless of area protection. The rights of the building's owner shall therefore still be respected even if the building is not protected. In particular, the lack of area protection does not justify griefing.
3. Protecting other's buildings in unprotected areas, unless for giving the protection area to the building's owner, is considered theft of another person's property; lands and buildings obtained like so shall not be considered the protector's property.
4. If a player is not a moderator, they shall not violate the rules, even if such acts aim to prevent other rule violations. However, this does not apply to acts stopping acts that may cause instant serious harm to in-game properties or any level of physical harm.
