<Annmaria> pls remove the protector blocks!
<_> i did
<RelaxingPlay> 1F616EMO is jioning
<RelaxingPlay> join
<_> yeah i know
<1F616EMO> hi all
<_> assess the situation
<1F616EMO> _: building is permitted as long as it is not disallowed (e.g. via area protection). Therefore, Ammmaria was permitted to build here. It is true that having construction here may not fit the city plan, but that's not Ann's fault as the Plain Houses Area was not protected.
<_> what should i do then
<1F616EMO> hence, your act of preventing Ann to build and removing their build may be considered griefing (I know you did that in good faith so I won't punish you)
<1F616EMO> here's ur protection block
<_> understood
<1F616EMO> thx for understanding and attempting to protect this server (though done wrongly)
<1F616EMO> I will forward these chat logs to Ann later
<_> okay
<1F616EMO> I should have protected the Plain Houses...
<1F616EMO> I will ask Ann what they wanted to build and I will give them this land if it fits the plan
<1F616EMO> hi Ann
<1F616EMO> solved; you can build here but I would like to know what you wanted to build
<1F616EMO> underscore: if what you have destructed contains expensive building materieals, return them to Ann
<Annmaria> A house for sale
<_> i returned the planks
<1F616EMO> OK
<_> tho she didnâ€™t pick them up and they disappeared
<1F616EMO> Oh no, that's not yours (_) fault then
<Annmaria> I dont need just a few planks anyway
<1F616EMO> Ann: OK, you can build here
<1F616EMO> but let me define a boundary first
<1F616EMO> how large would it be?
<Annmaria> abou 20 blocks
<1F616EMO> wide?
<Annmaria> in width
<1F616EMO> OK
<Annmaria> and in height it would be 11
<1F616EMO> Ann: don't start yet, I am doing protection and I will grant the area to u
<Annmaria> ok
<1F616EMO> Ann: height doesn't matter, I will grant you sufficant underground and overground space
<Annmaria> ok
<Annmaria> where is the land
<1F616EMO> defining
<Annmaria> k thanks
<1F616EMO> the four corners are defined with the fences
<1F616EMO> you can remove them as long as you can remember the bounadry
<1F616EMO> *boundary
<Annmaria> alright
<1F616EMO> you don't have to leave spaces for corridors on the side; I have already considered that
<1F616EMO> oops too fast
<1F616EMO> so all the lands inside are free for you
<Annmaria> thank you
<1F616EMO> np
<1F616EMO> ? water leakage?
<_> fixed
<1F616EMO> fine
<1F616EMO> underscore: BTW the process of doing acts against griefing or rights infringement cases should generally be done by moderators, therefore you should not destroy Ann's build
<_> got it
<1F616EMO> Thx
