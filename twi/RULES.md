## Administrative Team Regulations

The following rules govern the behavior of the management team and establish rules for appeals and final decision-making. Unless otherwise stated, these regulations apply to everyone.

1. The server owner has the authority to grant privileges to other players and also has the right to revoke the privileges granted to players. These actions do not require accompanying reasons.
2. Those granted the authority to ban players (`ban`) by the server owner are called **administrators**.
   Administrators and the server owner together are referred to as the **management team**.
3. The management team has the right to kick out or ban any player with provided reasons. Kicking out and banning together are referred to as **management actions**.
    1. If the actor is an administrator, the following rules apply:
        1. Bans exceeding seven days (604800 seconds) are not allowed.
           If a ban longer than seven days is deemed necessary, a seven-day ban must be applied first, and the server owner should be notified for further processing.
        2. Overriding the management actions of other team members is not allowed.
        3. The server owner must be informed after any management action is taken.
    2. Actions taken by the management team should comply with the server rules. However, actions taken by the server owner are not subject to this restriction.
4. If an administrator deems it necessary to take actions beyond the specified regulations, they may ignore the rules in clause 3.
   After taking such actions, the administrator should report to the server owner with specific reasons, following the rules in clause 3(1)(3).
5. If any player is dissatisfied or disagrees with any management actions of the team, they can file an appeal.
   Appeals must be accompanied by valid reasons; otherwise, the server owner has the right to reject them.
6. Appeals should be handled by the server owner or by others authorized by them. The person handling the appeal is referred to as the **appeal adjudicator**.
   In the appeal process, the appeal adjudicator has the right to modify or revoke relevant management actions made previously.
   If the relevant management actions were originally taken by the server owner, an opportunity for appeal should be provided, just as if these actions were originally made by an administrator.
7. If there is dissatisfaction or disagreement with the result of an appeal, an appeal can be filed again for that appeal. These subsequent appeals still follow the provisions of clauses 5 and 6.
   In the second or subsequent appeal cases, the appeal adjudicator has the authority to decide not to allow further appeals.
   Unless the appeal adjudicator makes a contrary statement, the fourth appeal is the final appeal, and no further appeals are allowed.
8. In cases determined or declared not to allow further appeals according to clause (7), the server owner has the right to decide at any time to allow an appeal for that case.
