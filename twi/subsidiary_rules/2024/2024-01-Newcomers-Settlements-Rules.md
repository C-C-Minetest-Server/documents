# Subsidiary Rules 1 of 2024: Newcomers' Settlements Rules

Author: 1F616EMO; State: Effective; Date effective: 16 March 2024

To prevent and penalize the abuse of newcomers' settlement plots and to grant the moderation team rights to manage such settlements.

## 1. Interpretation

In this rules, unless the context otherwise requires-

1. ***newcomers' settlements*** mean all locations listed in [Appendix 1](#appendix-1-list-of-newcomers-settlements);
2. ***newcomers' settlement plots*** mean any land or apartments in the newcomers' settlements allocated or built for sale by players who at the time were part of the moderation team, whether already sold or not;
3. ***owner***, when discussing the ownership of a newcomers' settlement plot-
    1. if sold, means the player who was granted ownership of the plot; and
    2. if not, means the moderator who allocated or built the plot.

## 2. Transfer of ownership of newcomers' settlement plots

1. Players, after buying a newcomers' settlement plot, could transfer the ownership of the plot. After such acts, the new owner shall be construed as the owner of the plot, as if they have bought the plot directly from the moderation team.
2. If a player grants access to their newcomers' settlement plot to another player without revoking their own right to access, unless otherwise agreed among them, such act shall not be considered an ownership transfer.

## 3. Revoking the ownership of newcomers' settlement plots

1. If a moderator revokes the ownership of a newcomers' settlement plot from a player, it means-
    1. revoking the ownership of the plot from the owner;
    2. clearing out the blocks (if any) not originally part of the plot;
    3. returning the properties obtained in the process of clearing out blocks;
    4. returning the money the owner paid for the plot; and
    5. selling the plot at its original price.
2. After finishing the acts defined in section (1), the newcomers' settlement plot should be treated as if it is not sold.

## 4. Prohibiting non-occupation of newcomers' settlement plots

1. If a newcomers' settlement plot is left unoccupied for at least 4 days, moderators could revoke the owner's ownership of the plot.
2. The time of non-occupation of a newcomers' settlement plot should be counted from (whichever the later)-
    1. The time the owner was granted the ownership of the plot; or
    2. The time the plot starts to not have any meaningful buildings.

## 5. Revoking the ownership of newcomers' settlement plots used to conduct rules-violating acts

1. If a player violates the rules, and one or some of their newcomers' settlement plot(s) are used to conduct such an act, moderators could revoke the owner's ownership of the plot(s), but not return the money the owner paid for the plot(s).
2. The revocation of the owner's ownership of a newcomers' settlement plot to be done according to section (1) should be on hold until-
    1. 4 days had passed starting from the time of the violation; and
    2. no appeals against the case are ongoing; and
    3. 4 days had passed starting from the time all appeals against the case had ended, if any were filed.
3. After the revocation of the owner's ownership of a newcomers' settlement plot according to section (1), if the player is eventually found not guilty of the violation, the moderator who revoked the ownership should return the ownership of the area, as if it was never revoked.
