## 2. Transfer of ownership of newcomers' settlement plots

1. Players, after buying a newcomers' settlement plot, could transfer the ownership of the plot. After such acts, the new owner shall be construed as the owner of the plot, as if they have bought the plot directly from the moderation team.
2. If a player grants access to their newcomers' settlement plot to another player without revoking their own right to access, unless otherwise agreed among them, such act shall not be considered an ownership transfer.

    3. returning the properties obtained in the process of clearing out blocks;
    4. returning the money the owner paid for the plot; and
    5. selling the plot at its original price.
2. After finishing the acts defined in section (1), the newcomers' settlement plot should be treated as if it is not sold.
3. If agreed by the owner of a newcomers' settlement plot, moderators may revoke the ownership of the plot from that player. Unless otherwise agreed, the revocation regulations defined in this part apply to the revocation act defined in this section.

    1. stayed neither occupied nor semi-occupied for more than 4 days; or
    2. stayed semi-occupied for more than 15 days.
2. If a player bought a newcomers' settlement plot, the above dates should be counted from when they purchased it.
3. In this part, ***occupied*** means -
    1. (For free-building plots) Having a meaningful building on the plot; or
    2. Having items inside storage nodes given upon purchase, if any.

        3. Placing down any blocks for supporting the mailboxes;
        4. digging away any blocks given upon purchase; and
        5. Reverting any acts mentioned above.
5. After modifying the Rules or any subsidiary rules, if a plot is deemed neither occupied nor semi-occupied but was not deemed so under the old rules, the dates mentioned in section (1) shall be counted from when the new rules are enacted.

## 5. Revoking the ownership of newcomers' settlement plots used to conduct rules-violating acts

    1. 4 days had passed starting from the time of the violation; and
    2. no appeals against the case are ongoing; and
    3. 4 days had passed starting from the time all appeals against the case had ended, if any were filed.
