2. If a player puts their property into the non-locked chests of a charity, they give up their ownership.
3. If a player takes property out of the non-locked chests of a charity, they gain ownership of the property.

## 3. Leaving a Will

1. Any player may leave a will by sending the will to the moderation team; such wills can be edited or repealed in the same way.
2. If a player is presumed to be permanently left, a moderator may distribute the player's property according to the will.

    2. For immovables, transfer their ownership to the server owner.
